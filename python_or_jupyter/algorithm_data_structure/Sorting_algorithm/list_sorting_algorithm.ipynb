    "In this implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm, my goal is to iteratively compare adjacent elements in a list and swap them if they are in the wrong order, eventually sorting the entire list. I start by calculating the length of the list (`list_a`) and subtracting 1 because the list uses 0-based indexing. I initialize a variable `sorted` as `False`, which will control the loop and indicate whether the list is fully sorted. The `while` loop continues running as long as `sorted` is `False`, assuming the list is sorted unless a pair of elements needs to be swapped. Inside the loop, I set `sorted = True`, and then I use a `for` loop to iterate through the list from the beginning to the second-to-last element. For each pair of adjacent elements, I compare them, and if they are in the wrong order (i.e., `list_a[i] > list_a[i+1]`), I swap them. I also set `sorted = False` when a swap occurs, signaling that the list may still not be sorted, so the `while` loop will continue. The swapping is done using Python's tuple unpacking, which swaps the two elements in a single line of code. This process repeats until no more swaps are needed, meaning the list is fully sorted. Finally, the function returns the sorted list. Although Bubble Sort is simple to implement and easy to understand, it’s not the most efficient algorithm for large datasets due to its relatively high time complexity."

If min_value is the same as i, no swap is needed because the element is already in the correct position.\n",
